1. 1dipole_standalone
  - I have tried to use the constraint on the higgs mass to generate xb from random xa gives born kinematics.
  - Phase space always lies in the singular regions.
  - for Dipole and real matrix element precisely local cancellation is happening. DIR= 1dipole_standalone
  - 

2. Planning to use .f95 in some codes slowly move to this version.

1. Openloops
    implementation of openloops in our code is completed
    1-real is matching with openloops, we can move forward with the matrix element in hand.
    LO is also matching with the openloops in heft
    ISSUE
    - Openloops also calculates the I operator however the i-operator for the heft process is not giving me the results. 
    - 
2. I operator is not available in Openloops. Will be updated soon.

1. Shell Scripts:
    updated to go from 13000 to 500 Gev.
    matrix individual data can be extrected for individual contribution.
2. PK Standalone:
   Plus Is working correctly for Linear mapping in the x kinematics.
   
3. Reference:
   Matrix results is now available in data files from 13000 Gev to 500 Gev
   this result is generated with 1d-4 precision. 
   with mur = muf = 62.5.

4. VirtuaL: 
   When I compared virtual data with the Matrix individual contribution there is an 
   overall constant factor which i need to figure out. 

5. Status of complete result.
   run_00_test_01 --> all the reference datas. for precision 1d-2(matrix)
