 1. Drell_Yan_ol_f95 : Working Now.✅
    LO matching with the MATRIX result. upto permillie
    ol is used to supply mat_amp
    
    real - dipole is also working now. Data validation is still pending.
   
    MATRIX data for matching LO is now produced. 

    individual distribution comparison is still pending. Only full invmass distribution is discovered yet.

1. f95 conversion ongoing
   converted the output display working perfectly now and is automated
  
2. Data comparison:
   Matrix is taking 62.5 as central scale and i was taking mH. there was mismatch with the reference data.
   Now the data for real, virtual, Lo is perfectly matching with that of matrix.

  there is still problems in the PK type of terms. the data isn't matching with that of matrix results.

~~~~~~~[ LATEST UPDATES ]~~~~~~~[ 25 : 03 : 2025 ]
1. PK_Plus under Isolated is now modified by using the new function PK(). 


2. pp2VH LO can now be computed for each points in PS points, since this is a loop induced process, |M11|^2 has to be computed.
   distribution is not matching with the reference data.
   In a stage to compare LO M^2 at each PS point.

3. there are many important files in the trash_ in the current update, which is not being tracked by git. But is present in the local machine. care must be taken. In order to save or removing these data.

4. Started converting fortran77 to fortran 95.
   Drell_Yan_f95

1. PK problem is now resolved. Problem carefully taken care. 
  
  misc.f new function constructed which is more redable. We can use PK(PKtype,Partontype,fxntype,x) in the computation without confision.
  all the negative signs are taken in the function itself. So we can just add all. 
  Care must be taken while summing Ktilde as there is a negative sign woth Ktilde that is not considered inside each function.
  For such case, 
  Kterm = Kbar - Ktilde 
  Pterm = P
  PK = Pterm + Kterm
  this will be more redable. I have used the equation numbers also into the code.

2. Output Display is used for compare3 and compare8 simultaneously.

   !!!!!!!~~~~~~ ISSUE in PK trerm ~~~~~~!!!!!!!!!!

1. Found 4 glitch/ error in PK part. 
   misc.f: delta part of Kbar has an overall negative sign. I have taken care of that, however the final result of delta part is giving large negative, which is not supposed to come.
   in the delta part there was two different PK_new.f files, however the file corresponding to our code is being taken by makefile. 
   I have removed that part.
   
2. There is some modifications on the DrellYan_all, I have removed some dir, as well summary data to the trash_. They are not required to be saved in the remote repository. With this UPDATE gg2Higgs is not matching PK part has to be cracked. 

3. Compare8.f combination issue resolved.
   there was problem with the file read as delta was also readinf same firstfile. corrected✅
 
THIS UPDATE IS MORE FICUSED IN PK_ISOLATED PART

4. Started working on the extraction of simultaneous distribution from the inclusive cross-section calculation 
   DrellYan_inv_tot is the working directory, where one can see that the distribution is somehow, double counted.

1. Virtual contribution:

   Virtual part of our code is matching with that of Matrix. 
   Openloops has by default some additional parameters turned on which effects the finite piece of 1loop
   
   with the parameter setup in this update @virtual contribution one can see iop_on=1 will give 
   IR subtracted result. 

   Minor update is done in MAKEFILE as the machine dependent part can be modified on config.mk file
   located in the parent directory which has access for all individual contribution. 
   dipole PK virtual and LO.

   At present, the eikonal understanding or 1loop understanding is not there with me. 
   Taking output of Openlooops as BLACKBOX the virtual part is concluded. We have to reproduce the 
   1loop as well as Eikonal or I-term so to match the finite piece they are using.

2. pp2VH Directory Created:

   Here, the pp2VH is just  copied from DY process.
   Working on the dipole_standalone part.

  before this I need to use the LO for matching to begin with.




~~~~~~~[ LATEST UPDATES ]~~~~~~~[ 25 : 02 : 2025 ]

1. there is an overall factor of 1/3 in the virtual contribution. 

  loop contribution comming from opnloops.
  only epsm2 is matching with eikonal
  epsm1 is also not matching with the eikonal

 even after I take the 1loop_finite + eikonal_finite
 there is a overall exta factor of 1/3 comming into our contribution.

     Tiny Eureka moment again
1. PK_ implementation is now working for gg2Higgs case.

2. DrellYan_mod is now working for invariant mass distribution only.
   this has greatly reduc3d the run time, however we lost the generality of the implementation.
   not in dipole,

	EUREKA MOMENT recorded
1. gg2Higgs has started to work. I have used Openloops to make it work.

2. Without making anymore modifications I am giving it a commit.

1. 1dipole_standalone
  - I have tried to use the constraint on the higgs mass to generate xb from random xa gives born kinematics.
  - Phase space always lies in the singular regions.
  - for Dipole and real matrix element precisely local cancellation is happening. DIR= 1dipole_standalone
  - 

2. Planning to use .f95 in some codes slowly move to this version.

1. Openloops
    implementation of openloops in our code is completed
    1-real is matching with openloops, we can move forward with the matrix element in hand.
    LO is also matching with the openloops in heft
    ISSUE
    - Openloops also calculates the I operator however the i-operator for the heft process is not giving me the results. 
    - 
2. I operator is not available in Openloops. Will be updated soon.

1. Shell Scripts:
    updated to go from 13000 to 500 Gev.
    matrix individual data can be extrected for individual contribution.
2. PK Standalone:
   Plus Is working correctly for Linear mapping in the x kinematics.
   
3. Reference:
   Matrix results is now available in data files from 13000 Gev to 500 Gev
   this result is generated with 1d-4 precision. 
   with mur = muf = 62.5.

4. VirtuaL: 
   When I compared virtual data with the Matrix individual contribution there is an 
   overall constant factor which i need to figure out. 

5. Status of complete result.
   run_00_test_01 --> all the reference datas. for precision 1d-2(matrix)
